BDD Evaluation homework for Code School Beta.

This function will take a sentence (or word) input and translate it into Pig Latin. Any words starting with a vowel will have "ay" added to the end of the word. Any word starting with a consonant will have the first letter moved to the end of the word, and then "ay" will be added to the end of the word. The result is displayed below the input form box.

Known issues:
1. The code does not verify the user input
2. The code does not check for special characters, and will translate them as part of the word
3. The code will translate an empty form box
